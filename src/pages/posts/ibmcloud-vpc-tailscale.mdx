## Overview

In this post I will show you how you can use Terraform to deploy a Tailscale [Subnet Router](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets) in an IBM Cloud VPC and connect it to multiple spoke VPCs in the same region. Subnet routers act as a gateway, relaying traffic from your tailnet to the VPC subnets without the need for each device to be running the tailscale agent.

In this demo environment we will connect a `hub` VPC, where the Subnet Router instance is running, to `prod` and `dev` VPCs in the same region via a local IBM Cloud [Transit Gateway](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-about&interface=cli). 

> You can also interconnect VPCs in different regions using a **Global** Transit Gateway, but for this example we will keep it local to keep the costs low.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] IBM Cloud [API Key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key)
- [ ] Tailscale [API Key](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
- [ ] Tailscale [Tailnet ID](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general). This is the `Organization` in the Tailscale admin console.
- [ ] Terraform [installed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) locally

## Getting started

### Clone repository and configure terraform variables

The first step is to clone the repository and configure the terraform variables.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cloud-design-dev/ibmcloud-vpc-ts-router.git
cd ibmcloud-vpc-ts-router
```

Copy the example terraform variables file and update the values with your own.

```shell
cp tfvars-template terraform.tfvars
```

#### Variables 

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| <a name="input_dev_prefix"></a> [dev\_prefix](#input\_dev\_prefix) | The address prefix to use for the dev\_vpc VPC | `string` | `"172.16.64.0/18"` | no |
| <a name="input_existing_resource_group"></a> [existing\_resource\_group](#input\_existing\_resource\_group) | The IBM Cloud resource group to assign to the provisioned resources. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_existing_ssh_key"></a> [existing\_ssh\_key](#input\_existing\_ssh\_key) | The name of an existing SSH key to use for provisioning resources. If one is not provided, a new key will be generated. | `string` | `""` | no |
| <a name="input_hub_prefix"></a> [hub\_prefix](#input\_hub\_prefix) | The address prefix to use for the hub VPC | `string` | `"192.168.0.0/18"` | no |
| <a name="input_ibmcloud_api_key"></a> [ibmcloud\_api\_key](#input\_ibmcloud\_api\_key) | The IBM Cloud API key to use for provisioning resources | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_ibmcloud_region"></a> [ibmcloud\_region](#input\_ibmcloud\_region) | The IBM Cloud region to use for provisioning VPCs and other resources. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_prod_prefix"></a> [prod\_prefix](#input\_prod\_prefix) | The address prefix to use for the prod\_vpc VPC | `string` | `"172.16.0.0/18"` | no |
| <a name="input_project_prefix"></a> [project\_prefix](#input\_project\_prefix) | The prefix to use for naming resources. If none is provided, a random string will be generated. | `string` | `""` | no |
| <a name="input_tailscale_api_key"></a> [tailscale\_api\_key](#input\_tailscale\_api\_key) | The Tailscale API key | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_tailscale_tailnet_id"></a> [tailscale\_tailnet\_id](#input\_tailscale\_tailnet\_id) | The Tailscale tailnet ID | `string` | n/a | yes |


### Initialize, Plan and Apply the Terraform configuration

Once you have the required variables set, you can initialize the terraform configuration and create a plan for the deployment.

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan -out=plan.out
```

If no errors are returned, you can apply the plan to create the VPCs, subnets, and compute instances.

```shell
terraform apply plan.out
```

When the provosion is complete, you should see the output of the plan, including the private IP addresses of the compute hosts.

```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 41 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

dev_node_ip = "172.16.64.4"
dev_vpc_subnet = "172.16.64.0/26"
hub_vpc_subnet = "192.168.0.0/26"
prod_node_ip = "172.16.0.4"
prod_vpc_subnet = "172.16.0.0/26"
ts_router_ip = "192.168.0.4"
```

### Approve the advertised subnets in the Tailscale admin console

By default the subnet router will not advertise any of the subnets until they are approved in the Tailscale admin console. From the admin console, navigate to the Machines tab and click the subnet router instance name. On the machine details page you should see the subnets that are available to be advertised.

![Subnets awaiting advertisement approval](https://images.gh40-dev.systems/awaiting-approval-subnets.png)

Under **Approved** click `Edit` and select the subnets you want to advertise and click `Save`.

### Connect to Tailscale and check connectivity

Once the subnets are approved, you can start the Tailscale app on your local machine and start testing connectivity to the private IP addresses of our VPC compute instances.

```shell
ssh root@<dev_node_ip>

# or

ssh root@<prod_node_ip>
```

### Clean up

To remove the resources created by the terraform configuration, you can run the `destroy` command.

```shell
terraform destroy
```

## Conclusion

In this example we have deployed a Tailscale subnet router in a hub IBM Cloud VPC and connected it to two spoke VPCs in the same region using a Transit Gateway. This allows us to connect in to our compute in these VPCs without the need for each device to be running the Tailscale agent.
