# Overview

I've decided to take on the [100 days of code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. I've been wanting to do this for a while, but I've always found an excuse not to. I'm not sure of everything I will touch in those 100 days, but I want to at least cover:

- Terraform (I'm a big fan of it, but I want to get better at and start writing modules)
- Ansible (and maybe some other configuration management tools)
- HashiCorp Vault, Nomad, and Consul (I'm familiar with them, but want to put them to use in a real project)
- Python (IBM Cloud SDK, FastAPI, Github Actions, etc)
- Kubernetes (I've been working with it for a while, but I am looking at getting a certificate this year)
- Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc)

So far I have a rough plan for the first 20 days, but I will be updating this as I go. I'm also going to be using this as a way to learn [Astro](https://astro.build/), so I will be updating the site as I learn to tweak the theme/settings.

## Week 1 (Terraform and Ansible)

 - Day 1: Creating an IBM Cloud VPC with Terraform. Since most of my compute will be in IBM Cloud, I want to start with this to lay the foundation for all of the workloads I will be deploying. 
 - Day 2: Extending the VPC with the use of Flow Logs and Cloud Object Storage. 
 - Day 3: Deploy some compute in to the VPC and use Data Engine to parse our flow logs for security events.
 - Day 4: Use Ansible to update, install configure the systems we deployed in Day 3.
 - Day 5: Deploy HashiCorp tools Vault, Consul, and Nomad on compute hosts using Ansible.
 - Day 6: Use Terraform to deploy a simple application to Nomad.
 - Day 7: Configure Vault to be a Certificate Authority.

## Week 2: (Python and IBM Cloud SDKs)

 - Day 8: Use the IBM Cloud Python SDKs to build a second lab VPC, matching the VPC from Week 1.
 - Day 9: Create a simple FastAPI application and deploy it to IBM Cloud Code Engine.
 - Day 10: Use Github Actions to build and deploy the FastAPI application to Code Engine.
 - Day 11: Use the IBM Cloud SDK to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in to the newly created VPC.
 - Day 12: Use IBM Cloud Continous Delivery to deploy the FastAPI app to Kubernetes.
 - Day 13: Simple Python application to interact with RabbitMQ.
 - Day 14: Simple Python application to create and manage projects from the command line.

## Week 3: (Kubernetes and Code Engine)

 - Day 15: Use the IBM Cloud SDK to deploy a Kubernetes cluster, configure monitoring and logging.
 - Day 16: Use IBM Cloud Continous Delivery to deploy the FastAPI app to Kubernetes.
 - Day 17: Use the IBM Cloud SDK to deploy a Code Engine application.
 - Day 18: Use IBM Cloud Continous Delivery to deploy the FastAPI app to Code Engine.
 - Day 19: ...
 - Day 20: ...
