It's been a hectic week, so only a few links in this first edition of Today I found. I hope you find them useful!

## Terminal 

 - [sshx](https://sshx.io/): a handy utility that lets you share your terminal with anyone by link. It features real-time collaboration, chat, and is  end-to-end encrypted.
 - [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/): a replacement for your existing shell history that supports sync and end-to-end encryption. It's like a time machine for your shell history with a handy TUI.
- [Radiogogo](https://github.com/matteo-pacini/RadioGoGo): a terminal-based internet radio player that lets you listen to radio stations from the around the world.

## Mac Apps

 - [Tart](https://tart.run/): A virtualization toolset that makes it dead simple to build, run and manage macOS and Linux virtual machines on Apple hardware (intel and apple silicon). 
 - [Ice](https://icemenubar.app/): A free alternative to the popular Bartender app for managing your Mac's menu bar icons. Especially useful for running demos or presentations.

## Music

Todays theme is ambient music generators. As I attempt to add more and more actual coding time to my day I find that ambient music helps me focus. Here are a few of my favourites:

 - [Ambiphone](https://ambiph.one)
 - [Moodist](https://moodist.app/)
