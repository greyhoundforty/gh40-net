# Overview

In this post, we will deploy the [request-baskets](https://github.com/darklynx/request-baskets) application on IBM Cloud Code Engine using Terraform. The `request-baskets` application is a simple HTTP requests collector that can be used to test webhooks, notifications, REST clients and more. The application stores the requests in a PostgreSQL database and provides a web interface to view the requests. 

## Prerequisites

- [IBM Cloud API Key](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)
- [Terraform installed locally](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

# Getting started

## Clone the repository

First, clone the `request-baskets` terraform repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/cloud-design-dev/ibmcloud-tf-ce-request-baskets.git
    cd ibmcloud-tf-ce-request-baskets
    ```

## Set Terraform environment variables 

Copy the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars`, open it in a text editor and set the following variables:

- **ibmcloud_api_key**: Your IBM Cloud API key.
- **ibmcloud_region** - The IBM Cloud region where you want to deploy the resources. Default is `us-south`.
- **existing_resource_group** - The name of the resource group where you want to deploy the resources.
- **existing_postgres_instance** - The name of the existing PostgreSQL instance where you want to store the requests.
- **project_owner** - Owner to associate with the project. Will be used as a tag for the resources.


## Initialize Terraform

Run the `init` command to initialize Terraform in the directory and download the required providers and modules:

    ```shell
    terraform init
    ```

## Generate the Terraform plan

Run the following command to generate a Terraform plan and save it to the file `default.tfplan`:

    ```shell
    terraform plan -out default.tfplan
    ```

Our plan output should show the resources that will be created, updated, or deleted. On the initial run we should see that the following resources will be created:

- IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL instance (optional, if you don't have an existing PostgreSQL instance)
- Service credentials for the PostgreSQL instance
- IBM Cloud Code Engine project
- IBM Cloud Code Engine application
- IBM Cloud Code Engine ConfigMap and Secret for PostgreSQL connection details
- Request-baskets master token. This allows you to see all baskets created by other users.

## Apply the Terraform plan

Run the following command to apply the Terraform plan:

    ```shell
    terraform apply default.tfplan
    ```

The Code Engine project will take a few minutes to get created. Once the project is created, Terraform will deploy our application using the `request-baskets` container image and add our PostgreSQL connection details to the running instance as environment variables. 

    ```shell
    terraform apply "default.tfplan"
    ...
    ...
    ibm_code_engine_app.request_baskets: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
    ibm_code_engine_app.request_baskets: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
    ibm_code_engine_app.request_baskets: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
    ibm_code_engine_app.request_baskets: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
    ibm_code_engine_app.request_baskets: Still creating... [50s elapsed]
    ibm_code_engine_app.request_baskets: Still creating... [1m0s elapsed]
    ibm_code_engine_app.request_baskets: Creation complete after 1m0s [id=xxxx-yyy-zzz/lqjv-rb-app]

    Apply complete! Resources: 8 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    app_url = "https://lqjv-rb-app.1glfavnwqwgu.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud"
    db_connection_details = <sensitive>
    request_basket_master_token = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
    ```

When the Terraform apply is complete, you will see the database connection details. the URL of the application, and the request-baskets master token in the Terraform output. Grab the URL and toss it in the browser to see the application in action.

The UI will auto-generate a basket name for you, but you can also give it a custom name. Click **Create** to create a new basket and start sending requests to it. You will see a pop-up with the basket name and the basket token. You can use the basket token or master token to view the requests in the basket. 

> **Note**: The token is automatically saved in your session, so you can view the requests in the basket without entering the token again. If you close the tab or refresh the page, you will need to enter the token again to view the requests.

With the new basket created, let's send it some data and see the results. You can use the `curl` command to send a request to the basket. Replace `YOUR_CODE_ENGINE_URL` with the URL of your application:

    ```shell
    curl -X POST https://YOUR_CODE_ENGINE_URL/YOUR_BASKET_NAME -d '{"name": "Chidi", "email": "chidi_a@mystomachhurts.net", "message": "I Hate Your Boots"}' 
    ```

Our basket page should refresh and show the new request.

## Inspect the basket ball

During the creation of our application, we also set a default basket with the name `ball`. You can use the master token to view the requests in the basket `ball`  at `https://YOUR_CODE_ENGINE_URL/web/ball`.

## Clean up

To clean up the resources created by Terraform, run the following command:

    ```shell
    terraform plan -destroy -out destroy.tfplan
    terraform apply destroy.tfplan
    ```

## Wrap-up

In this post, we deployed the `request-baskets` application on IBM Cloud Code Engine using Terraform with persistent storage backed by an IBM Cloud PostgreSQL instance.
