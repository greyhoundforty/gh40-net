# Overview

After getting dinged a few times by internal security scans I decided to write a script to scan all the servers in my IBM Cloud account for open ports. This python script will scan all the Floating IPs associated with your IBM Cloud account as well as the classic virtual and bare metal servers with public IPs. The script currently scans for SSH, RDP, Telnet, FTP, and SMTP but any port can be added to the scan list. 

## Prerequisites

- IBM Cloud API Key: This is used to authenticate with the IBM Cloud API. You can create an API key in the IBM Cloud console under **Manage > Access (IAM) > API keys** or using this [link](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
- python 3.10 or higher
- IBM Cloud CLI installed (optional: only used with the Code Engine deployment option)

## Running the script locally

1. *Export the IBM Cloud API Key*: In order to run this script locally you will need to export the API key to the environment variable `IBMCLOUD_API_KEY`. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```

2. *Install the required python packages*: I include the `ibm_platform_services` library here so we can get back more verbose API exceptions in the event of an error.

    ```shell
    pip install SoftLayer ibm_vpc ibm_platform_services
    ```

3. *Download the script*: You can use the curl command provided or copy from the embedded gist below and save it to your local machine as `scan_ibmcloud.py`.

    ```shell
    curl "https://snips.cdetesting.com/f/eH9-cgu2iB?r=1" -o scan_ibmcloud.py
    ```

4. *Invoke the script*: The script will take a few minutes to run as it scans all the floating IPs and classic infrastructure servers in your account.

    ```shell
    python scan_ibmcloud.py
    ```

5. *Inspect the results*: The scan results should provide output similar to the following:

    ```shell
    $ python scan_ibmcloud.py
    Starting scan of floating IPs...
    Open ports on 169.x.y.zzz: [22]
    Open ports on 169.x.y.zzz: [3389]
    Scan complete.

    Starting scan on classic infrastructure virtual guests...
    Scan complete.

    Starting scan on classic infrastructure bare metals...
    Open ports on 169.x.y.zzz: [3389]
    Scan complete.
    ```

## Automate the scan using Code Engine

If you want to automate this scan you can use IBM Cloud [Code Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-about) to run the script on a schedule. Code Engine allows you to run your code in a serverless environment without having to manage the underlying infrastructure or any of the scaling, TLS, etc. The Code Engine project and resources can be created using the IBM Cloud Portal or the IBM Cloud CLI. I will outline the CLI method below.

### CLI Method

1. **Install the IBM Cloud CLI and required plugins**: If you don't have the IBM Cloud CLI installed you can download it from the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started) page or use one of the pre-configured [IBM Cloud Shell](https://cloud.ibm.com/shell) environments.

    ```shell
    ibmcloud plugin install code-engine
    ibmcloud plugin install container-registry
    ```

2. **Export environment variables**: The following variables will be used in the CLI commands below.

    - *IBMCLOUD_API_KEY*: Your IBM Cloud API key.
    - *ICR_ENDPOINT*: The Container registry endpoint to use for the container image. Use the `Private domain name` from the list of available endpoints [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_overview#registry_regions_local).
    - *ICR_NAMESPACE*: The namespace in the container registry where the image will be stored. The namespace name must be unique in the region across all IBM Cloud accounts.
    - *ICR_IMAGE*: The name of the container image to be created.

    ```shell
    export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
    export ICR_ENDPOINT=private.us.icr.io
    export ICR_NAMESPACE=<your container namespace>
    export ICR_IMAGE=account-port-scan
    ```

    

3. **Login to the IBM Cloud CLI**: Use the `-r` flag to target the region and the `-g` flag for the Resource Group. The resource group must be set for the Code Engine plugin to work.

    ```shell
    ibmcloud login
    ibmcloud target -r <REGION> -g <RESOURCE_GROUP>
    ```

4. **Create the Code Engine project**: It is important to note that the project will take a few minutes to be created. Once the project is created the CLI will automatically switch to the project context. You can add tags to the project to help with organization and filtering using the `--tag` flag.

    ```shell
    ibmcloud ce project create --name scan-ibmcloud --tag supercooltag1 --tag supercooltag2
    ```

5. **Create project secrets**: There are 2 main secrets we need to create for our Code Engine job. The first is the IBM Cloud API key used to authenticate and scan our account and the second is the registry secret. The registry secret is used to authenticate with the IBM Container Registry. 

    ```shell
    ibmcloud ce secret create --name ibmcloud-api-key --from-literal IBMCLOUD_API_KEY="${IBMCLOUD_API_KEY}"

    ibmcloud ce registry create --name us-icr-secret --username iamapikey --password "${IBMCLOUD_API_KEY}" --email yourmail@example.com --server "${ICR_ENDPOINT}"
    ```

6. **Create a build configuration**: With Code Engine we can build our container image directly from a git repository. The following command will create a build configuration that will build the container image from the `jobs/account-port-scan` directory in the git repository and store the container image in the IBM Container Registry.

    ```shell
    ibmcloud ce build create --name port-scan-build --source https://github.com/cloud-design-dev/dts-ce-demo --context-dir jobs/account-port-scan  --image "${ICR_ENDPOINT}/${ICR_NAMESPACE}/${ICR_IMAGE}:latest" --registry-secret us-icr-registry --output json
    ```
