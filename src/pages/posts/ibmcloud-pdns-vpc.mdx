## Overview

In a previous [post]() I showed you how to deploy a Tailscale subnet router in an IBM Cloud VPC and and advertise multiple VPC subnets to your larger tailscale network. In this post we will look at another use case that includes using the [DNS Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dns-svcs?topic=dns-svcs-about-dns-services) offering as well as [Custom Resolvers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dns-svcs?topic=dns-svcs-custom-resolver) to allow you to access services running in your VPC from your local network using their Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

In this demo environment we will deploy a VPC, provision a subnet router instance, and then deploy some sample services in the VPC. We will then use the IBM Cloud DNS Services to create a custom resolver that will resolve the FQDN of these services to the private IP address of our instances. We will then connect to the subnet router using Tailscale and test the resolution of the FQDN.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] IBM Cloud [API Key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key)
- [ ] Tailscale [API Key](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
- [ ] Tailscale [Tailnet ID](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general). This is the `Organization` in the Tailscale admin console.
- [ ] Terraform [installed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) locally

## Getting started

### Clone repository and configure terraform variables

The first step is to clone the repository and configure the terraform variables.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cloud-design-dev/ibmcloud-ts-router-pdns.git
cd ibmcloud-ts-router-pdns
```

Copy the example terraform variables file and update the values with your own.

```shell
cp tfvars-template terraform.tfvars
```

#### Variables 


### Initialize, Plan and Apply the Terraform configuration

Once you have the required variables set, you can initialize the terraform configuration and create a plan for the deployment.

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan -out=plan.out
```

If no errors are returned, you can apply the plan to create the VPCs, subnets, and compute instances.

```shell
terraform apply plan.out
```

When the provosion is complete, you should see the output of the plan, including the private IP addresses of the compute hosts.

```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 41 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

dev_node_ip = "172.16.64.4"
dev_vpc_subnet = "172.16.64.0/26"
hub_vpc_subnet = "192.168.0.0/26"
prod_node_ip = "172.16.0.4"
prod_vpc_subnet = "172.16.0.0/26"
ts_router_ip = "192.168.0.4"
```

### Approve the advertised subnets in the Tailscale admin console

By default the subnet router will not advertise any of the subnets until they are approved in the Tailscale admin console. From the admin console, navigate to the Machines tab and click the subnet router instance name. On the machine details page you should see the subnets that are available to be advertised.

![Subnets awaiting advertisement approval](https://images.gh40-dev.systems/awaiting-approval-subnets.png)

Under **Approved** click `Edit` and select the subnets you want to advertise and click `Save`.

### Connect to Tailscale and check connectivity

Once the subnets are approved, you can start the Tailscale app on your local machine and start testing connectivity to the private IP addresses of our VPC compute instances.

```shell
ssh root@<dev_node_ip>

# or

ssh root@<prod_node_ip>
```

### Clean up

To remove the resources created by the terraform configuration, you can run the `destroy` command.

```shell
terraform destroy
```

## Conclusion

In this example we have deployed a Tailscale subnet router in a hub IBM Cloud VPC and connected it to two spoke VPCs in the same region using a Transit Gateway. This allows us to connect in to our compute in these VPCs without the need for each device to be running the Tailscale agent.
