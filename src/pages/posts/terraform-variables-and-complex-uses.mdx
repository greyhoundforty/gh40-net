# Terraform Variables 


## Primitive vs Complex Variables

Terraform has two main types of variables: primitive and complex. Primitive variables are simple values like `strings`, `numbers`, and `booleans`. Complex variables, as the name implies, support more complex data structures like `lists`, `maps`, and `objects`. 

### Primitive Variables 

- **string:** A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.

```hcl
variable "ibmcloud_region" {
    description = "The VPC region where resources will be deployed."
    type = string
    default = "us-south"
}
```
 
- **number:** A number is a numeric value. Terraform supports both integer and floating point numbers.

```hcl
variable "address_count" {
    description = "The number of addresses assigned to the VPC subnet."
    type = number
    default = 128
}
```

- **boolean:** A boolean is a value that can be either `true` or `false`.

```hcl
variable "create_public_gateway" {
    description = "Indicates whether VPC public gateway should be created for a subnet."
    type = bool
    default = true
}
```
